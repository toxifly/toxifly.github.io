# Project Instructions

## Overview

This project is a web-based card game, likely a roguelike deck-builder, involving a client (built with React/Vite) and a server (built with Node.js/Express/WebSocket) potentially using the Games Fun SDK. The client handles presentation and user interaction, while the server manages game state, logic, and rules.

## File Structure
.
├── client/ # Frontend React application (Vite) - Responsible for displaying the game state received from the server and sending user actions back.
│   ├── node_modules/ # Project dependencies for the client (React, Vite plugins, etc.).
│   ├── public/ # Static assets accessible directly by the browser (e.g., favicon, initial images).
│   ├── src/    # Client-side source code (React components, context providers, API/WebSocket communication logic, styles).
│   │   ├── App.tsx # The main application component. It sets up the GamesFunProvider to initialize the SDK and provide its context to the rest of the application. Renders the main Game component.
│   │   ├── Game.tsx # The core component responsible for rendering the game interface. It uses the `useGamesFun` hook to get SDK status/connection details and the `useGame` hook (from `GameContext`) to access the game state, configuration, and WebSocket connection status. It displays loading/error states and conditionally renders different UI views (e.g., `GameUI` during fighting, rewards, game over) based on the current `gameState.phase`. Defines a `GAME_ACTIONS` constant object to hold the string names for actions sent to the server (e.g., 'autoPlayCard', 'selectReward').
│   │   ├── components/ # Reusable UI components.
│   │   │   ├── GameUI.tsx # The main UI displayed during the 'fighting' phase. Takes the current `GameState` and arranges the `PlayerDisplay`, `EnemyDisplay`, and `CardDisplay` components to show the player's stats, the enemy's stats, the current card in hand (if any), and the next card to be drawn.
│   │   │   ├── CombatantDisplay.tsx # Displays core combatant stats (HP, Block, Momentum) and any active buffs/debuffs (using BuffIcon) based on a CombatantState object. Intended for reuse by PlayerDisplay and EnemyDisplay.
│   │   │   ├── PlayerDisplay.tsx # Displays the player's specific stats, leveraging the CombatantDisplay component and adding player-specific information like energy. Takes a `PlayerState` object as a prop.
│   │   │   ├── EnemyDisplay.tsx # Displays the enemy's stats by wrapping CombatantDisplay. It adds a specific background image for the enemy based on `enemy.id` (from `public/images/enemies/`). Takes an `EnemyState` object as a prop.
│   │   │   ├── BuffIcon.tsx # Displays an icon for a given Buff, showing its name, description, stacks, and duration on hover. Uses images from `public/images/buffs/` based on the buff ID.
│   │   │   └── CardDisplay.tsx # Renders a single card based on its `CardDefinition`. Displays cost, name, description, and image (from `public/images/cards/`). Includes an optional visual style to indicate if it's the "next card" via the `isNextCard` prop.
│   │   ├── context/ # React context providers for managing global state.
│   │   │   └── GameContext.tsx # Manages the WebSocket connection to the game server, triggered by the `privyId` from `useGamesFun`. Establishes the connection, sends a 'register' message upon opening, and handles incoming messages: 'init' (sets initial `GameState` and `GameConfig`), 'state_update' (updates `GameState`), and 'error'. Manages connection state (`isConnected`, `error`) and provides the game state, config, connection status, and a `sendMessage` function to child components via the `useGame` hook. Includes cleanup logic to close the WebSocket on disconnect or component unmount.
│   │   └── ... (other components, contexts, etc.)
│   ├── index.html # Main HTML entry point for the single-page application.
│   ├── package.json # Defines client dependencies (e.g., `react`, `@privy-io/react-auth`, `@games-fun/react`) and npm scripts (e.g., `dev`, `build`).
│   ├── tsconfig.json # TypeScript configuration specific to the client application.
│   └── ... (other Vite config files) # Configuration for the Vite build tool.
├── server/ # Backend Node.js application - Manages game logic, state persistence per player, action validation, and WebSocket communication with clients.
│   ├── node_modules/ # Project dependencies for the server (Express, WebSocket library, etc.).
│   ├── src/ # Server-side source code (TypeScript).
│   │   ├── config.ts # Stores static game configuration constants (e.g., `PLAYER_MAX_HP`, `PLAYER_START_ENERGY`, `MOMENTUM_PER_CARD`, reward counts) used for balancing and defining core game rules.
│   │   ├── data/ # Contains static data definitions for game elements.
│   │   │   ├── cards.ts # Defines all available cards in the game, including their cost, effects (as an array of `CardEffect`), and description. Card images are derived from the card `id` (e.g., `id: 'strike'` corresponds to `strike.png`). Exports a `cards` object mapping card IDs to `CardDefinition`.
│   │   │   └── enemies.ts # Defines the base stats (`maxHp`, `maxEnergy`) and decks for all enemy types. Enemy images are derived from the enemy `id`. Exports an `enemies` object mapping enemy IDs to `EnemyDefinition`.
│   │   ├── types.ts # Contains all shared TypeScript type definitions and interfaces for game entities (e.g., `CardEffect`, `CardDefinition`, `Buff`, `CombatantState`, `PlayerState`, `EnemyState`, `EnemyDefinition`, `GameState`, `GameConfig`) and actions (`ActionRequest`). Ensures type safety across the server codebase and consistency with client expectations. `GameState` includes player/enemy details and reward options. `GameConfig` holds static game data (cards, enemies, constants). `ActionRequest` defines the structure for client-to-server commands.
│   │   ├── gameManager.ts # Implements the core game logic and state management using the `DefaultGameManager` class. It holds the game state for active players (`playerStates` map). Key methods include:
│   │   │   - `getState(playerId)`: Retrieves the current `GameState` for a player. If no state exists, it calls `initializeNewGameState` to create one.
│   │   │   - `setState(playerId, state)`: Updates the stored `GameState` for a player.
│   │   │   - `validateAction(playerId, action)`: Validates and processes player actions (logic pending).
│   │   │   - `applyCardEffects(...)`: Applies card effects (logic pending).
│   │   │   - `startNewFight(...)`, `generateRewards(...)`: Handles transitions between game phases (logic pending).
│   │   │   - `initializeNewGameState(playerId)`: Creates the initial `GameState` for a new player, setting up floor 1, initial player HP/energy/deck (from config), the first enemy (from data), setting phase to 'fighting', shuffling the deck, and drawing the first card (using helper stubs).
│   │   │   - `drawCard(playerState)`, `shuffleDeck(playerState)`: Helper methods for deck manipulation (stubs implemented, full logic pending).
│   │   │ It uses the `GameConfig` provided during instantiation to access card/enemy data and game constants.
│   │   └── index.ts # The main entry point for the server application. Initializes the Express app, creates an HTTP server, and sets up WebSocket communication (`ws`). It loads the game configuration (`GameConfig`) and instantiates the `DefaultGameManager`. It handles incoming WebSocket connections (`wss.on('connection')`), specifically listening for a 'register' message containing a `playerId`. Upon registration, it retrieves the initial `GameState` (using `gameManager.getState`, which now initializes if needed) and the `GameConfig`, sending them back to the client in an 'init' message. It maintains maps (`activeConnections`, `wsPlayerMap`) to associate player IDs with their WebSocket connections and handles connection cleanup (`ws.on('close')`, `ws.on('error')`). It also defines basic HTTP API endpoints:
│   │   │   - `GET /api/config`: Returns the static `GameConfig` object.
│   │   │   - `GET /api/state/:playerId`: Returns the current `GameState` for the specified player, initializing it if necessary.
│   │   │   - `POST /api/validate-action`: Accepts a player action (body: `{ playerId: string, action: ActionRequest }`) and currently returns a stub success response (actual validation logic pending).
│   ├── package.json # Defines server dependencies (e.g., `express`, `ws`, `typescript`, `ts-node`) and npm scripts (e.g., `start`, `dev`).
│   └── tsconfig.json # TypeScript configuration specific to the server application.
