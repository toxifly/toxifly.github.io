Always read [instructions.md](mdc:instructions.md), follow the instructions there if any.
It includes up to date descriptions of the files structure and all the functions and how they work.
If you make any changes to the files or folders always update the instructions file - include a short, but comprehensive description of the functions and files in the project, enough to understand what it does and how it works.
If no files are included you should read the instructions file to see which files will be needed for you to execute the task provided.
When implementing new functionalities always do it in a way that will keep the code easy to read and edit, prefer to create many files and smaller functions, for easier context retrieval.
Update [readme.md](mdc:readme.md) with basic instructions about how to run it and typical readme file content.

Let me know which files you need to access so I can add them to your context
